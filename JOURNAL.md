This is my journal of the design and building process of **3D Printed Single Shaft Shredder**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/98).


## 10/3/2025 - First Steps, Planning  

Well, it's shredder time! 
Here are some goals for the project: 
- utilize 3D printing for design flexibility
- shred stuff (pretty straightforward)
- I'll try to utilize metal shaft/blades if necessary
The goal is to make it intuitive and reasonable, with as many features as possible.
I'm thinking modularity and safety, as well as easy incorporation into other systems (mounting!)
Attached is an inspiration for the shredder blades!
