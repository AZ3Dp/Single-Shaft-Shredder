This is my journal of the design and building process of **3D Printed Single Shaft Shredder**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/98).


## 10/3/2025 - First Steps, Planning  

Well, it's shredder time! 
Here are some goals for the project: 
- utilize 3D printing for design flexibility
- shred stuff (pretty straightforward)
- I'll try to utilize metal shaft/blades if necessary
The goal is to make it intuitive and reasonable, with as many features as possible.
I'm thinking modularity and safety, as well as easy incorporation into other systems (mounting!)
Attached is an inspiration for the shredder blades!

Made some decent progress making the CAD file for the shredder. I will go over some highlights and features. 
Highlights:

- I made an object that sort of looks like a shredder. 
- It took me a while to figure out the best way to model it
	- I am trying to use separate components, which is considered "good organization" in CAD
	- This will prove useful if I ever happen to want to make animations

Features:

- I set up groups of 3 blades: this will displace the cutting, enabling less torque necessary to cut the material 
	- This is visualized using different colors
- There are also a set of fixed blades the rotating blades will be cutting into
- The fixed blades are connected to the "base", utilizing the flexibility of 3D printing technology
