# Shredder
A project on manufacturing a plastic shredder for extremely low costs

_I'll try to make this short and sweet_
If you've ever set foot on Planet Earth, you will be aware of the sheer amount of plastic we humans use. And even more terrifying is the amount of plastic we waste and dump into our oceans.

People have started initialives all around the world to recycle plastic. From government funded organizations, to massive non-profits, many passionate groups and individuals have attempted to tackle the problem of recyling plastics.
But why are we still where we're at?
_first off, we have made fabulous progress on ending plastic waste. Do not become disheartened! We are making great progress!_
I believe it is due to the 1) hassle and 2) costs of recycling.
##
#The hassle
People don't feel like recyling because they don't feel incentivized to do so. Yes, some programs reimburse those who recycle, but it's not **enough** for the masses to participate.
#The costs
Having a recycling system costs a lot - even those "budget friendly" systems. Not everyone is fortunate to have $500 to cash out on a plastic shredder.

#My solution
That's why, I've worked many hours to develop a mostly 3D printable (and soon plastic injection moldable shredder). 
Shredding plastic is the first step to the majorit5y of plastic recyling processes - smaller shreds are easier to work with.
I believe that we can use plastic to shred plastic. Plastic is cheaper, easily used & 3D printed, and a lot more "user-friendly" than metal.
Here's the intuition: a solid piece of a shredder blade can cut through the thin layers of plastic water bottles.
Of course, some metal must be used for structural parts, but they must be off-the-shelf parts.
So here we go!!!
